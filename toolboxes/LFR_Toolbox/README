Current version of the LFR Toolbox: v2.1 released on 1 April 2014
Revised by C. Roos and J-M. Biannic (ONERA)

Main changes:
- implementation of a Simulink interface for LFR objects generation and simulation
- adaptation of symtreed.m and sym2lfr.m to ensure compatibility with MuPAD symbolic engine
- modification of distlfr.m to reduce computational time in case of a large number of uncertainties
- minor bugs fixed
